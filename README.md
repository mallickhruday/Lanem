## About
Lanem is an extremely light weight HttpModule to globally handle ASP.NET errors.

It doesn't implement any HTTP endpoints to view error logs from a remote location. The logs can only be accessed by someone who has access to the production environment.

## Support

Currently the project supports ASP.NET applications built with .NET Framework 3.5, 4.0, 4.5 and 4.6.

## Installation

Please use the official [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/) feed to download and install the package in your ASP.NET application.

This project follows the [semver](http://semver.org/) convention.
